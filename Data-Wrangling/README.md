# Data Wrangling
Data Wrangling also known as Data Cleaning,Data Remediation or Data Muning refers to a set of process used to convert the raw data into more usable format.
Eeample: Detecting the gaps, Identifying extreme outliers

## Steps Involved:

#### Discovery
This is a term for understanding or getting familiar with your data. You must take a look at the data you have and think about how you would like it organized to make it easier to consume and analyze. 

#### Structuring
When raw data is collected, it’s in a wide range of formats and sizes. It has no definite structure, which means that it lacks an existing model and is completely disorganized. It needs to be restructured to fit in with the Analytical Model deployed by your business, and giving it a structure allows for better analysis.
This is a process whereby relevant information is extracted from fresh data. For example, if you are dealing with code scrapped from a website, you might parse HTML code, pull out what you need, and discard the rest. 
This will result in a more user-friendly spreadsheet that contains useful data with columns, classes, headings, and so on.

#### Cleaning
Most people use the words Data Wrangling and Data Cleaning interchangeably. However, these are two very different processes. Although a complex process in itself, Cleaning is just a single aspect of the overall Data Wrangling process.
For the most part, raw data comes with a lot of errors that have to be cleaned before the data can move on to the next stage. Data Cleaning involves Tackling Outliers, Making Corrections, Deleting Bad Data completely, etc. This is done by applying algorithms to tidy up and sanitize the dataset.

#### Enriching
At this stage of the Data Wrangling process, you’ve become familiar with, and have a deep understanding of the data at hand. Combining your raw data with additional data from other sources such as internal systems, third-party providers, etc. will help you accumulate even more data points to improve the accuracy of your analysis. Alternatively, your goal might be to simply fill in gaps in the data.

#### Validating
Validating the data is an activity that services any issues in the quality of your data so they can be addressed with the appropriate transformations. 

The rules of data validation require repetitive programming processes that help to verify the following:

Quality
Consistency
Accuracy
Security
Authenticity

#### Publishing
By this time, all the steps are completed and the data is ready for analytics. All that’s left is to publish the newly Wrangled Data in a place where it can be easily accessed and used by you and other stakeholders.
